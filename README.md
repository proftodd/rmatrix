# RMatrix

C implementation of basic matrix operations using integer arithmetic

To install (after cloning):
```
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ make -C build && make test -C build
```

I've only tested the build, compilation, testing, and installation on my Mac. CMake is supposed to be cross-platform, but YMMV.
